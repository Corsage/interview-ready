 * Amazon has launched a website Amazon Geeks. They have a cart system with cart items
 * represented in the form of a SinglyLinkedListNode. We perform the following operations.
 * Each operation consists of two strings: an action and an item name.
 * 
 * 1) "PUSH_HEAD itemName" - Inserts a new item with [data] as itemName as the head of the linked list.
 * 2) "PUSH_TAIL itemName" - Inserts a new item with [data] as ItemName as the tail of the linked list.
 * 3) "POP_HEAD -" - Deletes the current head of the linked list, the "-" is a filler value.
 * 
 * We return a reference to the lead of the final linked list after applying all the queries.
